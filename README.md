# vulkan-compute-examples
This repository contains some example codes using Vulkan Compute.

## Motivation
It's really hard to actually do something with Vulkan. So, I wrote simple example code for those trying to write code using Vulkan Compute. (Yeah, it wasn't simple at all to just get it running.) I'll add some more examples, but I highly recommend using Kompute[https://github.com/KomputeProject/kompute]. They've done some awesome work.

## Environment
The code is tested on an M3 MacBook. I just installed LunarG Vulkan SDK[https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home], and it worked.
